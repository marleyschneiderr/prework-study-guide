        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
        <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
        <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li>
          <li>When adding a CSS file to an existing HTML file, the rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>When adding a CSS file to an existing HTML file, the href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
