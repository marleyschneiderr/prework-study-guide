        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
        <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
        <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
        <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
        <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
        <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li>
          <li>When adding a CSS file to an existing HTML file, the rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>When adding a CSS file to an existing HTML file, the href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semi colon.</li>
          <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>To link a JavaScript file with an HTML file, the script.js file is linked within the body element.</li>
          <li>When on the default browser, to view JavaScript using Chrome DevTools, press Command+Option+I on your keyboard. This will pop up on the right hand side of the default browser.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform. In our example, we created two separate functions: one for our for loop and one for our if statement.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
