# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project was to create a clear outline of topics learned in the pre-work so I can refer back to this guide as I make my way through the UW Web Development Bootcamp. I want to use this webpage as a reference for upcoming lessons and projects.
- I built this website to better understand the topics I will be learning in the Web Development Bootcamp and to keep track of resources I can use when running into problems I may face while completing course work. 
- This webpage solves the problem of not knowing where to start learning about Web Development or how to understand basic concepts that we will build off of throughout our coursework. 
- I learned how to successfully code an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript webpage that can run live on the internet. I also learned how to use GitHub and connect all languages into one beautiful working website.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can help a user understand how to set up and code a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript page. It will teach you how to upload your coded pages to Github in order to access your website on the actual internet. You can navigate through each section to understand key commands and rules to follow when coding each language. Each section contains specific notes related to each language that reference best practices to create a working website. For example, a key finding on this webpage will tell you that if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. This page will list topics we learned in Prework and select one of the topics to learn first, followed by the rest.
